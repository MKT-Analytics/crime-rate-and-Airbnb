# Neighborhood crime influence on AirBnB listings

Investigating the influence of crime rate in New York City on the number of AirBnB listings per neighberhood.

## Research motivation
The growth in popularity of peer-to-peer rental platforms such as AirBnB in recent years has brough several benefits but also concerns to the neighbourhoods. One of the major concerns is the crime rate in the neighbourhoods around AirBnB rental properties. Not only the people living in these areas get affected in terms of their safety, but also crime has to be shown to have a negative effect on property values and businesses (Lens and Meltzer, 2016). Thefore, it is important to investigate how the growth of AirBnB affects the crime rate. For the purpose of this study, an example of in New York City will be used. The data on AirBnB listings in NY City is available on Inside AirBnB and the complaint data reported to the New York City Police is available on NYC Open Data.
